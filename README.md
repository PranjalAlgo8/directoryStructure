# Project Name: AI-Powered Data Processing and Model Inferencing Pipeline

## Overview
This project is designed to automate the process of data ingestion, preprocessing, model inference, and post-processing for a variety of use cases. The architecture is modular, allowing for easy integration of new data sources, models, and post-processing steps. The entire workflow is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and scale in different environments.

## Key Components

### 1. `app.py`
- **Description**: This is the main application file that serves as the entry point for the entire project. It calls the `run()` function from the `src` module and executes scheduled runs for batch processing or API-based model inferencing.

- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
- **Features**:
  - Scheduling batch processes.
  - Triggering the data pipeline and model inference flow.
  - Logging and error handling.

### 2. `Dockerfile`
- **Description**: Defines the Docker environment for the project. It specifies the base image, installs dependencies, and sets up the environment to run the application.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t ai_pipeline_image .
  docker run -d -p 5000:5000 ai_pipeline_image
  ```
- **Key Sections**:
  - `FROM`: Base image for the environment.
  - `COPY`: Copies the application files to the container.
  - `RUN`: Installs dependencies.
  - `CMD`: Command to run the application inside the container.

### 3. `.gitignore`
- **Description**: Lists files and directories to be ignored by Git version control. This helps prevent unnecessary files (like logs, temporary files, and environment-specific configurations) from being tracked.
- **Contents**:
  - Logs and temporary files.
  - Python cache files (`__pycache__/`).
  - Environment configuration files.

### 4. `requirements.txt`
- **Description**: Lists all the Python package dependencies required for the project. It ensures that all necessary libraries are installed.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Dependencies**: Common libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `configparser`, and more.

### 5. `README.md`
- **Description**: This file contains documentation for the entire project. It provides an overview, setup instructions, usage examples, and other relevant details.

### 6. `logs/`
- **Description**: Directory for storing log files. The logging system records events and errors for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.
  - **LatestLogs.log**: Contains the most recent logs of application execution.

### 7. `src/`
- **Description**: This is the core directory containing all the source code, including configuration management, data processing, model inferencing, and utility functions.

#### 7.1 `src/__init__.py`
- **Description**: Initializes the `src` module and contains the `run()` function, which serves as the main orchestrator for the application's workflow.

#### 7.2 `src/config/`
- **Description**: Manages configuration settings for the project.
  - **config.ini**: Configuration file with various project settings.
  - **configRead.py**: Contains the `ConfigReader` class, which reads and parses the `config.ini` file.

#### 7.3 `src/preProcessing/`
- **Description**: Handles all preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation.
    - **process(data)**: The main function that orchestrates all preprocessing steps.

#### 7.4 `src/postProcessing/`
- **Description**: Handles all post-processing tasks such as result aggregation, report generation, and visualization.
  - **process(data)**: The main function that orchestrates all post-processing steps.

#### 7.5 `src/inferencing/`
- **Description**: Manages model inference, including model selection, loading pre-trained models, and generating predictions.
  - **inferencing.py**: Main script for performing inference.
  - **model_selection.py**: Logic for selecting the best model based on criteria.

### 8. `Plantbrain/`
- **Description**: External folder for any PlantBrain-specific logic or modules. This may contain additional code, data, or configuration files specific to the PlantBrain platform.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Update Configuration**:
   - Edit the `config/config.ini` file with the required settings such as database connections, API keys, and file paths.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

# config Module

## Overview
The `config` module is responsible for managing configuration settings for the project. It includes files and classes that help in reading, parsing, and utilizing configuration values from a central configuration file (`config.ini`). This module ensures that all configuration-related parameters are centrally managed and easily accessible throughout the application.

## Module Structure
The `config` module is structured as follows:

```
config/
├── __init__.py
├── config.ini
└── configRead.py
```

## Files and Description

### 1. `__init__.py`
- **Description**: This file makes the `config` directory a Python module. It initializes the `ConfigReader` object, making it accessible to other parts of the application. It can also be used for setting up logging or initial configurations related to the `config` module.

### 2. `config.ini`
- **Description**: The main configuration file for the project. It stores various configuration settings in a structured format using sections and key-value pairs. This file is used to define parameters such as database connections, API keys, file paths, and other configuration values.
- **Structure**:
  ```
  [section_name]
  key1 = value1
  key2 = value2
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```
  [database]
  host = localhost
  user = admin
  password = secret

  [logging]
  log_level = DEBUG
  log_file = logs/LatestLogs.log
  ```
- **Usage**: This file is read by the `ConfigReader` class in `configRead.py` to fetch configuration values required by the application.

### 3. `configRead.py`
- **Description**: Contains the `ConfigReader` class, which is responsible for reading and parsing the `config.ini` file. This class provides methods to access configuration values in a structured manner, ensuring that all settings are available to the application components when needed.

#### `ConfigReader` Class
- **Purpose**: To read and provide access to the configuration settings defined in the `config.ini` file.
- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(self, config_file_path='config/config.ini')`: Initializes the `ConfigReader` object with the path to the configuration file. Reads and parses the `config.ini` file, storing sections and values internally.
  - `get(self, section)`: Returns a dictionary of key-value pairs for the specified section. If the section is not found, it returns an error message.

#### Usage Example
```python
from config.configRead import ConfigReader

# Initialize the ConfigReader
config_reader = ConfigReader('config/config.ini')

# Fetch a section from the config.ini file
status, db_config = config_reader.get('database')
if status:
    print("Database Configuration:", db_config)
else:
    print("Error:", db_config)
```

## Usage
1. Ensure that the `config.ini` file is up-to-date with all required settings.
2. Import the `ConfigReader` class from the `configRead.py` module.
3. Use the `get` method to fetch configuration values for the desired section.

## Best Practices
- **Centralized Configuration**: Keep all configuration settings in the `config.ini` file to maintain consistency and avoid hardcoding values.
- **Sensitive Data**: Avoid storing sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) directly in the `config.ini` file for security reasons. Consider using environment variables or encrypted storage.
- **Error Handling**: Always handle cases where a section or key might be missing from the configuration file to avoid runtime errors.

## Dependencies
- The `configRead.py` module uses the `configparser` library to read and parse the `config.ini` file. Ensure that this library is installed in your environment.

```bash
pip install configparser
```

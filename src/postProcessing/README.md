# postProcessing Submodule

## Overview
The `postProcessing` submodule is responsible for managing all the steps required to process and format the output data after model inference or data analysis. This includes tasks such as result aggregation, report generation, and visualization. The submodule is designed to provide a clear and structured way to handle post-inference tasks, ensuring that the output is ready for further interpretation or reporting.

## Submodule Structure
The `postProcessing` submodule is organized as follows:

```
postProcessing/
├── __init__.py
├── result_aggregation.py
├── report_generation.py
└── visualization.py
```

### Files and Directories

#### 1. `__init__.py`
- **Description**: This file initializes the `postProcessing` submodule and contains the main `process()` function. The `process()` function serves as the entry point for all post-processing steps, calling various functions from other scripts within the submodule to execute the complete post-processing workflow.
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  from data_processing.postProcessing import process

  # Assuming 'inference_results' is your model output
  final_output = process(inference_results)
  print("Post-Processing Output:", final_output)
  ```

#### 2. `result_aggregation.py`
- **Description**: Contains functions for aggregating and summarizing the model inference results. It helps in compiling the results from multiple sources or models into a cohesive summary.

#### 3. `report_generation.py`
- **Description**: Contains functions for generating detailed reports based on the processed data. This may include creating PDF reports, summary tables, or exporting data to different formats like Excel.

#### 4. `visualization.py`
- **Description**: Contains functions for creating visualizations such as charts and graphs to represent the results in a more understandable and insightful manner.

## Usage Workflow
1. **Call the `process()` Function**: Use the `process()` function in `__init__.py` to run all post-processing steps sequentially.
2. **Result Aggregation**: The inference results are aggregated and summarized using functions in `result_aggregation.py`.
3. **Report Generation**: Detailed reports are created using functions in `report_generation.py`.
4. **Visualization**: Visual representations of the results are generated using functions in `visualization.py`.
5. **Output**: The `process()` function returns the final processed output, ready for interpretation or presentation.

## Dependencies
- **Libraries**: The `postProcessing` submodule may depend on the following libraries:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and summary.
  - `matplotlib` or `seaborn`: For creating visualizations.
  - `reportlab`: For generating PDF reports.

Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn reportlab
```

## Extending the Submodule
1. **Adding New Functions**: Create a new `.py` file for the new post-processing step, or add the function to an existing file if relevant.
2. **Update `process()`**: Update the `process()` function in `__init__.py` to include the new function in the post-processing workflow.
3. **Testing**: Test the new function independently and as part of the overall `process()` workflow to ensure compatibility.
